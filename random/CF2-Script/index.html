<a href=https://github.com/bbawj/site/random/CF2%20Script.md rel=noopener>Edit Source</a></p><ul class=tags></ul><p>**Good morning Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How and fellow members of the Forward Singapore team. I am Brendan, a computer science and business student from NTU and I am here today to share with you about my idea to equip every Singaporean with the opportunity to thrive.</p><p>Singapore is increasing its emphasis on digitization for much of our core systems. In this year&rsquo;s National Day Rally, Prime Minister LHL gave an update on the Tuas Port. It will incorporate the use of Artificial Intelligence in order to streamline port services such as vessel traffic management and port clearance. Effective development and application of technology will allow it to support upwards of 65 million TEUs of cargo. (include some stats)</p><p>Moreover, Mr Lee also spoke about the importance of top talent to the prosperity and success of SG&rsquo;s future. And without a doubt, building up home grown talent in the field of information technology will be key to sustaining the backbone of much of the services which keeps Singapore running. (maybe stats here is better?)</p><p>To achieve this, I believe that we must start young. Your ministry also believes the same, and have already started its own enrichment programme, Code For Fun, which offers a 10 hour curriculum focused on digital literacy to all primary and secondary school students.</p><p>This programme is a good start, but more needs to be done in terms of offering a more in-depth curriculum that is also widely available. Currently, one solution for children wanting to learn more is through external commercial centers which offers children focused coding programmes.</p><p>However, this means that some children are being left behind. Underprivileged families, who may find these skills important but yet cannot afford to send their children for commercial classes are stuck. Here I would like to introduce my idea for KidsCode. Our slogan is creating opportunities through code and we want to to fill this gap by providing a free and in-depth curriculum for children of disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p><em>What will CITC do?</em>
KidsCode will aim to develop computational thinking skills in the children that participate. Now what is computational thinking? Simply put, it is the ability to think like a computer. Fret not, this does not mean that we will be stifling the creative minds of our youth, but rather the opposite. Computational thinking is the ability to use logical and structured ways to break down difficult problems, and to encourage the use creativity to come up with novel solutions.</p><p>At the same time we aim to inculcate other important values such as resilience through guided mentorship, and confidence through project presentations.</p><p><em>types of classes</em> (add Scratch example animation in Slide)
To begin with, we will offer 2 types of classes which will cater to different age groups. For 8-12 year olds, we will offer lessons in Scratch. Scratch is an introductory language which provides many inbuilt features for creating games and animations. This visual element is key to keeping younger kids engaged.</p><p>For 13-16 year olds, we will offer lessons in python, a simple yet extremely powerful programming language capable of building complex systems. This will provide natural progression for kids who are already more familiar with technology.</p><p>KidsCode will run with the support of volunteers. We will start with volunteers from Singapore&rsquo;s local universities. Student interest groups with a passion for technology and wish to be part of the children&rsquo;s learning journey will form the backbone of our curriculum. As a technical director of NTU&rsquo;s Open Source Society, our team will be the first to take the lead to contribute to this initiative.</p><p><em>KidsCode schedule</em>
KidsCode will run once a week, with each session being 1 hour long. I hope that such a schedule will provide a well-paced learning environment where the kids can take time to understand difficult concepts without adding too much pressure to their lifestyle.</p><p>With your support, we hope to expand KidsCode in 2 ways.
Firstly, with increased funding, we want to provide training for our volunteers. This will allow us to accept volunteers with weaker technical backgrounds and increase our impact through greater manpower.
Secondly, we hope that your support will unlock opportunities to work with key industry partners like Google.</p><p>To conclude, I would like to share a quote from Alvin Toffler, a famous American futurist. &ldquo;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&rdquo;
We at KidsCode want to create an opportunity for those who are willing and capable to learn, unlearn and relearn, to thrive and to grow. Together, KidsCode can be that first stepping stone for these bright children to gain these skills and realize their full potential, regardless of their starting point in life. Lets move forward Singapore! Thank you!</p><p>Question and Answer</p><ol><li>You mentioned that you want to work with industry partners, why?<ul><li>Industry partners will be able to bring in the expertise and special internal tools that may improve the children&rsquo;s learning. These are aspects which student volunteers do not have.</li><li>By meeting and interacting with people from the industry, we also hope that the children become inspired to discover more about the possibilities of technology.</li></ul></li><li>How long will KidsCode run for? Is it throughout the year?<ul><li>Due to manpower being sourced from student volunteers, we will run the classes over the course of the regular school semester. This means classes will run for 4-5 months at a time.</li></ul></li><li>How would u inculcate resilience and confidence?<ul><li>Resilience: our volunteers will act as mentors to help the kids through difficult problems that they face. For example, when their program does not work as they expect and have to make iterations, these situations will teach them the importance of not giving up, and when to seek help.</li><li>Confidence: each lesson is part of a larger project which the children are working on. By providing opportunities for them to showcase their work to the class as well as talk through their ideas and processes, we hope to build up their speaking confidence.</li></ul></li><li>Are the children obligated to join every lesson? What if they miss some.<ul><li>The children encouraged to join every lesson, but there is no obligation for them to attend all. This is because we want to promote a culture of self-paced learning.</li></ul></li><li>Where is KidsCode held?<ul><li>It will take place at various libraries, community centres and other public buildings around Singapore. Venues may change from run to run.</li></ul></li><li>How will you promote KidsCode to the community?<ul><li>For a start, we will promote this initiative through social media as well as through public advertisements or brochures in selected community centers.</li><li>In terms of convincing parents of the importance of these skills, we will offer chances for parents to sit in and take a look at the work we do. This ensures transparency and allows the parents to make an informed decision about whether this programme is right for their child.</li></ul></li></ol></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://www.brendanang.dev/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Brendan Ang using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.brendanang.dev/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/bbawj>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
