How horrendous? It had to do with concurrency. The bug came as a side effect from a cycle in our service API bug detection program. Our program ran by recursively following the verdict result from failing services. After some debugging, essentially:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR;\n\tA(Service A) --\u003e B(Service B);\n\tB --\u003e C(Service C);\n\tC --\u003e A;\n```\nImmediately a task was issued to implement a fix to detect the cyclic verdict mechanism which was trapping our program. This is a simple problem, once one is able to frame the problem as a cyclic detection problem, it devolves to [a leetcode easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/). The widely accepted optimal solution which uses O(1) space is [Floyd's tortoise and hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare)two pointer solution. In our case, to implement such a solution would mean establishing an additional runner to complete the loop, finding a cycle only after a minimum of 1 full additional cycle has been made. This would not have made the most sense, as this meant making additional requests to our verdict endpoint, increasing the overall latency to determine this rare cyclic case. Our go-to solution became the naïve method of storing visited nodes in a HashMap, and checking against it before continuing down our call sequence.\n\nAlgorithms knowledge provides the programmer with options. The solution to a real-world issue may not be the same algorithm used in a leetcode problem, but the ability to frame the problem, and have the knowledge of different potential solutions and their trade-offs is an essential everyday skill.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.476164879Z","tags":null},"/Blog/ByteDance-2nd-Round":{"title":"ByteDance - 2nd Round","content":"# ByteDance - 2nd Round\nI applied to ByteDance for a backend engineering internship role in video infrastructure. Due to a lack of research, I found myself in a system design interview rather than a leetcode style one. My interviewer was an SRE - Software Reliability Engineer, who seemed quite surprised that I knew what an SRE was (thanks to my role at Shopee monitoring the stability of the UAT environment, which is not much unlike an SRE). \n## The Question\n*\"A poor business man wants to set up a new business, selling cloud storage to customers. However, he only has 4 old servers, each of 1 TB capacity.\"*\n\nQuestions in order:\n1. Design the IO flow of such a system, to support basic features of uploading and downloading files given a specific file path.\n2. How could we support multiple clients?\n3. What if a client wants to upload a file larger than the capacit of a single server ( \u003e 1 TB)?\n4. One of the servers failed, causing data loss and large costs to compensate users for the lost/corrupted data. How could we improve the reliability of the 4 servers.\n5. The businessman wants to be able to *oversell* his service. With only 4TB of storage, we need to be able to sell 8TB worth to customers. This is on the basis that not all customers will use all the storage they purchased.\n## Wow I am bad\nPointers 4 and 5 are most interesting, and stumped me during the interview.\n\nQuestion 4:\nWith only 4 servers, and the constraint of being poor, a RAID configuration was not feasible. I think the interviewer expected me to list some redudancy algorithms, but with no knowledge or experience, I couldn't provide any.\n\nQuestion 5:\nThis question and the answers from the interviewer, brought into light the technical difficulties which the cloud storage services we use face everyday. One solution is to compress the files uploaded. If we can compress and decompress files on the fly while serving requests to clients, we can make the 4TB of storage go a long way. Pair this up with *virtual uploads*. \n\nVirtual uploads is based on the assumption that every individual does not *really* have many personal files or data. This means a majority of storage that most people ever really make use of, is for public files - files such as music, or the first season of The Office. Ever wondered what Google Drive is doing during the *Scanning File* portion when you upload a file? Apparently, the local file is being hashed in its entirety and sent to the server to check if Google already has the same file in its store. This means that multiple users will have pointers to the same file stored on the server, and the local file is only \"virtually\" uploaded.\n\nThe final step, and last resort, is to provision more servers. It is hard to provision servers out of thin air, and once bought, they start to add to the cost of the business. Here the interviewer mentioned how one could make use of the constraint on network and bandwith speeds as the time the business will have to provision more servers. \n\n## Life's tough\nIf it is not yet evident, I definitely did not come up with any of the responses above. A lot of very smart people have had to come up with such solutions and implement them in the real world. I wonder what other problems lie in plain sight, but have solutions which most will remain oblivious to.","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.476164879Z","tags":null},"/Brag-Doc":{"title":"Brag

It prevents A* from skipping the optimal solution.\n\n\u003e [!Example] Suppose you're trying to [drive from Chicago to New York](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago+to+New+York\u0026saddr=Chicago\u0026daddr=New+York\u0026hl=en\u0026ll=41.294317,-80.81543\u0026spn=11.071941,20.302734\u0026sll=41.656497,-82.155762\u0026sspn=11.010616,20.302734\u0026geocode=FWICfwIdGuDG-inty_TQPCwOiDEAwMAJrabgrw%3BFVA6bQIdS8KW-yk7CD_TpU_CiTFi_nfhBo8LyA\u0026t=h\u0026z=6) and your heuristic is what your friends think about geography. If your first friend says, \"Hey, Boston is close to New York\" (underestimating), then you'll waste time looking at routes via Boston. Before long, you'll realise that any [sensible route from Chicago to Boston](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Chicago\u0026daddr=Boston\u0026hl=en\u0026ll=42.228517,-79.343262\u0026spn=10.912859,20.302734\u0026sll=40.63063,-73.87207\u0026sspn=11.183158,20.302734\u0026geocode=FWICfwIdGuDG-inty_TQPCwOiDEAwMAJrabgrw%3BFZ9WhgIdw7bD-ykbMT0NLWXjiTGg6GIBJL98eA\u0026t=h\u0026mra=ls\u0026z=6) already gets fairly close to New York before reaching Boston and that actually going via Boston just adds more miles. So you'll stop considering routes via Boston and you'll move on to find the optimal route. Your underestimating friend cost you a bit of planning time but, in the end, you found the right route.\n\nGuaranteed to expand no more nodes than UCS: Heuristics guide the search towards the goal node which prevents expansion of redundant nodes.

For example, if an application's HTML contains `\u003capp-hero-list\u003e\u003c/app-hero-list\u003e`, then Angular inserts an instance of the `HeroListComponent` view between those tags.\n\n`templateUrl`\n\nThe module-relative address of this component's HTML template. Alternatively, you can provide the HTML template inline, as the value of the `template` property. This template defines the component's _host view_.\n\n`providers`\n\nAn array of [providers](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#provider) for services that the component requires. In the example, this tells Angular how to provide the `HeroService` instance that the component's constructor uses to get the list of heroes to display.\n\n\n## Templating\nIn a file in the form of `\u003cname\u003e.component.html`.\n\n### Data Binding\n![](https://i.imgur.com/emwdOkY.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D3fnw4j.png)\n\n#### 2 way binding\n\n\n### Pipes\nWe can use pipes to transform values into a specific display format in our view. \n\nAngular defines various pipes, such as the [date](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe) pipe and [currency](https://angular.io/api/common/CurrencyPipe) pipe; for a complete list, see the [Pipes API list](https://angular.io/api?type=pipe). You can also define new pipes.\n\nTo specify a value transformation in an HTML template, use the [pipe operator (`|`)](https://angular.io/guide/pipes): \n```\n{{interpolated_value | pipe_name}}\n```\n\n### Directives\nAngular templates are dynamic. When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given by directives. A directive is a class with a ``@Directive()`` decorator.\n\n#### Structural directives\nThey alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in the DOM. [Guide]()\n\n| Directive                                                      | Details                                                                               |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`*ngFor`](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#ngFor) | An iterative; it tells Angular to stamp out one `\u003cli\u003e` per hero in the `heroes` list. |\n|[`*ngIf`](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#ngIf)                                                                |A conditional; it includes the `HeroDetail` component only if a selected hero exists.|                                                                                       |\n\n```typescript\n\u003cli *ngFor=\"let hero of heroes\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003capp-hero-detail *ngIf=\"selectedHero\"\u003e\u003c/app-hero-detail\u003e\n```\n\n#### Attribute directives\nThey alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element. In templates they look like regular HTML attributes, hence the name. [Guide](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives)\n\n| Directive | Details |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| [ngModel](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) | `ngModel` modifies the behavior of an existing element (typically `\u003cinput\u003e`) by setting its display value property and responding to change events.        |\n\n\n\n## Services\n```\nng generate service \u003cname\u003e\n\nng g s \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n### Dependency Injection\nAngular uses [Dependency Injection](Notes/Dependency%20Injection.md) to increase modularity.\n\nUse [](Notes/Dependency%20Injection.md#Constructor%20injection%20%7CConstructor%20Injection) to utilize a service:\n```typescript\nexport class ProductDetailsComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor(\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,\n    private cartService: CartService\n  ) { }\n}\n```\n\n### Hitting APIs\nConfigure [HTTPModule](https://angular.io/start/start-data#configure-appmodule-to-use-httpclient)\n\nData is passed from services to components via [Observables](https://angular.io/guide/observables)\n#### [Get](https://angular.io/guide/http#requesting-data-from-a-server)\n```typescript\nclass SomeService{\n\tconstructor(private http: HttpClient){}\n\tget(): Observable\u003cTask[]\u003e{\n\t\treturn this.http.get\u003cTask[]\u003e(this.apiUrl)\n\t}\n}\n```\n#### [Post](https://angular.io/guide/http#making-a-post-request)\n#### [Delete](https://angular.io/guide/http#making-a-delete-request)\n#### [Put](https://angular.io/guide/http#making-a-put-request)\n#### [Error handling](https://angular.io/guide/http#handling-request-errors)\n\n## RxJS Observables\nMakes use of the [Observer Pattern](Notes/Observer%20Pattern.md).\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9wOu11uU6U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe use `Observables` when there is some stream of data that is changing and we have multiple subscribers that want to change when there is some new data.\n![500](https://i.imgur.com/aoiTL89.png)\n\nRxJS provides multiple functions to modify how often we want to call next(), in what ways to format the data etc. \n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Arrays-and-Slices":{"title":"Arrays and Slices","content":"# Arrays and Slices\n## Arrays\n![Screenshot 2022-08-24 at 6.33.10 PM](Pics/Screenshot%202022-08-24%20at%206.33.10%20PM.png)\n## Slices\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pmb83Wv.png)\n\n### Slice reallocation\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ORzY1Ky.png)\n### Deletion\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aXxo47i.png)\n### Pitfalls\nSince a slice is a pointer to an array, passing a slice into a function will allow the function to modify the original array.\n\nHowever, if slice reallocation occurs inside this new function, the function will no longer be modifying the original array:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3uoV8dh.png)\nTo avoid this, we can return the modified array from the func\n### Goroutine Unsafety\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gSFVh8C.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/B+-Tree-Index":{"title":"B+ Tree Index","content":"# B+ Tree Index\nIdea: build a multi-layer index in the structure of a [B-tree](Notes/B-tree.md)\n\u003e [!Properties]\n\u003e 1.

After initialization, the while loop in lines 2-6 causes these two pointers to move down the tree, going left or right depending on the key comparison, until x becomes NIL.  We need the trailing pointer y, because by the time we find the NIL where z belongs, the search has proceeded one step beyond the node that needs to be changed.

When a cache miss occurs, compute cycles are needed to find a victim, request the appropriate data from memory, fill the cache line with this new block and resume execution.\n### Types of Misses\n#### Compulsory miss\nFirst reference to a given block of memory. This is an inevitable miss as data has not been accessed before.\n#### Capacity miss\nThis occurs when the current working set exceeds the cache capacity. Current useful blocks have to be replaced.\n#### Conflict miss\nWhen useful blocks are displaced due to placement policies. E.g. fully associative cache mapping\n### Design considerations\n- Number of blocks\n\t- More blocks means that we will have larger capacity and result in lesser capacity misses\n- Associativity\n\t- Reduce conflict misses\n\t- Increases access time\n- Block size\n\t- Larger blocks exploit spatial locality. More data in the same area is loaded together when requested.\n\t- Reduces compulsory misses since more data is loaded at once.\n\t- Reduces number of cache blocks for a fixed block size. This leads to increase in conflict miss as higher chance for different data map to the same blocks.\n\t- Increases miss penalty as more data needs to be replaced on a miss.\n- Levels of cache\n\t- Using multi-level cache will reduce the miss penalty\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PKhDsDq.png)\n### Measuring Impact with CPI\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\u0026CPU_{time}=(CPU_{\\text{execution cycles}}+\\text{Memory stall cycles})\\times\\text{Cycle Time}\\\\\n\u0026CPU_{time}=((IC\\times CPI)+(IC\\times\\%\\text{Memory Access}\\times\\text{Miss Rate}\\times\\text{Miss Penalty}))\\times \\text{Cycle Time}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n![](https://i.imgur.com/38DnZ86.png)\nL1 cache hit can be considered to be part of CPI ideal as it is often possible to complete the data access within the ideal clock cycles.\n#### Example\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pcXWyud.png)\n#### Multi-level cache example\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pN98QXK.png)\n### Measuring Impact with Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) \nWe need a way to measure the performance of cache, standalone from the performance of the CPU.\nAMAT is the average time to access memory considering both hits and misses\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nAMAT\u0026=\\text{Hit Time}\\times(1-\\text{Miss Rate})+\\text{Miss Rate}\\times(\\text{Hit Time}+\\text{Miss Penalty})\\\\\n\u0026=\\text{Time for hit}+\\text{Miss Rate}\\times\\text{Miss Penalty}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNote here that *Miss Penalty* is the loss in cycles for a miss, and not just the cost of main memory access. e.g If time to hit cache = 1, time to hit main memory = 100, miss penalty is $100-1=99$.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4RDpPr0.png)\nOne example to show that AMAT is superior would be to consider two different caches with similar miss rates, but drastically different hit times. Using the miss rate metric, we would rate both caches the same.

When choosing item to be evicted:\n\t1. If the item has use-bit = 1, we reset it back to 0 (this item has used its second chance)\n\t2. Else we evict it (no second chance, replace it)\n7.

Actions involve the same element\n2. At least one is a write\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hpD2zat.png)\n#### Precedence Graph\nWe can use a precedence graph to determine if a set of transactions are conflict serializable. An edge from one node to another represents a constraint on the order of the transactions. i.e. Actions in a transaction t1 cannot be swapped with another transaction t2. If a cycle occurs, the order of transactions become contradictory and no serial schedule can exist.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/01GqFEg.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PzNgNGH.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hqlUQN3.png)\n### Recoverable Schedule\nA schedule is recoverable if transactions commit only after all transactions whose changes they read have committed.\nElse, the DBMS is unable to guarantee that transactions read data that will be the same as before the crash and after the crash.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mC9bKDu.png)\n## Locks\nEnsure that data items that are shared by conflicting operations are accessed one operation at a time. Same as with [Process Synchronization](Notes/Process%20Synchronization.md). \n![](https://i.imgur.com/0IiEBMH.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gHcnbL4.png)\n### Two Phase Locking (2PL)\nArbitrary assignment of locks do not lead to a serializable schedule. Two transactions can operate on elements in a different order resulting in different results. We can solve this by ensuring that transactions take up all lock actions before all unlock actions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IVf95ET.png)\n#### Why 2PL works?\nIntuitively, each two-phase-locked transaction may be thought to execute in  its entirety at the instant it issues its first unlock request. i.e. a legal schedule can only be such that the transaction completes fully, because otherwise, this means that another transaction is attempting to take a held lock, causing a deadlock. Hence, there is at least one conflict-serialisable schedule: the one in which the transactions appear in the same order as first unlocks.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4WIMEGr.png)\nSuppose the schedule starts with T1 locking and reading _A_. If T2 locks _B_ before T1 reaches its unlocking phase, then there is a deadlock, and the schedule cannot complete. Thus, if T1 performs an action first, it must perform _all_ its actions before T2 performs any. Likewise, if T2 starts first, it must complete before T1 starts, or there is a deadlock. Thus, only the two serial schedules of these transactions are legal.\n### Lock mechanisms\n#### Shared and Exclusive locks\n- Shared lock: to allow for multiple transactions to perform `READ`\n- Exclusive lock: for `WRITE`\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ap4gy0W.png)\nA transaction should only ask for an exclusive lock when it is ready to write, so that any read operations can still continue. Upgrade the lock when needed:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3uWyyJ9.png)\n#### Update locks\nDeadlocks can occur when transactions are unable to upgrade their shared locks to exclusive ones, since there are already shared locks taken. A separate lock type that may be later upgraded to an exclusive lock is needed.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5zCmLxd.png)\n#### Compatibility matrix\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NqG3L6i.png)\n### Workings of Scheduler\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8zwE14N.png)\n1. Part 1: Inserts appropriate lock actions ahead of all DB access operations and release the locks held by the Transaction when it aborts/commits\n2. Part 2: maintains a waiting list of transactions that need to acquire locks\n## Deadlock Detection \u0026 Prevention\n### Timeout\nPlace a limit on how long a transaction may be active, if it exceeds this time, it is forced to release its locks and other resources and roll back.\n### Waits-For Graph\nUtilises the [cyclic properties of deadlocks](Notes/Deadlocks.md#Cyclic%20Properties%20of%20Deadlocks) to detect them.\n- Each transaction holding a lock or waiting for one is a node\n- An edge exists from T1 to T2 if there is some element A where:\n\t- T2 holds a lock on A\n\t- T1 is waiting for lock on A\n\t- T1 cannot get the lock on A unless T2 releases it\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4GcWNC7.png)\nThis graph can become very large ad analysing this graph for every action can take a long time.\n### Timestamps\nAssign each transaction with a timestamp. This timestamp never changes for the transaction even if it is rolled back.\n#### Wait-Die\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f1MbRut.png)\n#### Wound-Wait\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RLvfh5T.png)\n### Comparison\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gslOHOC.png)\n## Timestamp Ordering\nAn optimistic approach. Use the timestamps of transactions to determine the serialisability of transactions. \n- Each transaction receives a unique timestamp TS(T). \n- If TS(Ti ) \u003c TS(Tj ), then the DBMS must ensure that the execution schedule is equivalent to a serial schedule where Ti appears before Tj .\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aIy3ZQn.png)\n### Rules\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gl6dz77.png)\n- A transaction wants to read, but the element has already been written to by another transaction\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iOeaFDw.png)\n- A transaction wants to write, but the element has already been read by another transaction or written by another transaction\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ku6Zq5d.png)\n### Thomas Write Rule\nWhen a transaction wants to write, and TS(T) \u003c WT(X), ignore the write and allow the transaction to continue without aborting. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jggXLS7.png)\n- Timestamp ordering creates conflict serialisable schedules when this rule is not used\n- Schedules are not recoverable as TO does not have any checks\n## Comparisons\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OvQkJJm.png)\n## Multi Version Concurrency Control\nA misnomer as it is not actually a concurrency control protocol.\nDBMS maintains multiple physical versions of a single object in the database:\n- When transaction writes to an object, the DBMS creates a new version\n- When transaction reads an object, it reads the newest version that exists when the transaction started\nEach user connected to the database sees a _snapshot_ of the database at a particular instant in time. Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed, providing isolation\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rxyuTCY.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hMcMZuF.png)\n### Concurrency Protocol\nAble to use any concurrency protocol to underly its implementation. MVCC is simply another layer on top of these protocols to provide transactional memory.\n### Version Storage\nDBMS creates a version chain per tuple, which allows it to find version that is visible to a particular transaction at runtime. There are indexes which point to the head of the chain.\nVersion ordering:\n- Oldest to Newest: append new version at the end of chain -\u003e the entire chain has to be traversed for look ups\n- Newest to Oldest: append new version at the head of the chain, update index pointers to the head for every new version\n#### Append only\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nkFmNRj.png)\n#### Time travel storage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ug9aDBy.png)\n#### Delta storage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zU5zSIj.png)\n### Garbage Collection\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vdwgroe.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cArxcjN.png)\n## Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bg5zD3I.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d7wWbX9.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wa44loe.png)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR;\n\tT3 --\u003e T2;\n\tT1 --\u003e T2;\n\tT3 --\u003e T1;\n\t\t\n```\n| Time | T1       | T2       | T3      |\n| ---- | -------- | -------- | ------- |\n| t1   |          |          | Read(A) |\n| t2   |          |          | Read(B) |\n| t3   | Read(A)  |          |         |\n| t4   | Read(C)  |          |         |\n| t5   | Write(A) |          |         |\n| t6   |          | Read(C)  |         |\n| t7   |          | Read(B)  |         |\n| t8   |          | Write(C) |         |\n| t9   |          | Write(B)         |         |\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJx9TNc.png)\nIn 2PL, all locks must be acquired by the transaction, operations are done and then all locks are released at once.\nThis is schedule is not consistent with 2PL.\nT1 takes ul(B), xl(B), ul(D), xl(D).

Entry is made in per process OFT and a pointer to the entry is returned.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YG1FRQs.png)\nThe open file tables saves substantial overhead by serving as a cache for the FCB. Data blocks are *not* kept in memory, instead, when the process is closed, the FCB is entry is removed and the updated data is copied back to the disk.\n#### File Descriptor\nA file descriptor is a non-negative integer which indexes into a per-process file descriptor table which is maintained by the kernel. This in turn indexes into a system-wide open file table. It also indexes into the inode table that describes the actual underlying files. All operations are done on the file descriptor\n### Storage allocation\nFile-Organisation Module: allocates storage space for files, translates logical block addresses to physical block addresses, and manages free disk space.\n#### Contiguous\nEach file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on the disk.\nAdvantages:\n- Simple as only starting location and length is required\n- Supports random access\nDisadvantages:\n- Finding a hole big enough may result in external fragmentation\n- File space is constricted by size of the hole, it might need to be moved to a bigger hole in the future\n- If file space is overestimated there will be internal fragmentation\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YKfQr9s.png)\n\u003e [! The delete operation]\n\u003e Deleting a data block stored with contiguous allocation requires shifting of the data blocks.\n\u003e *e.g. Delete data block 5 in a file with 10 data blocks*:\n\u003e i.e. Read block 6, write block 5 with data from block 6, read block 7 and write block 6 with block 7 etc.\n#### Linked\nEach file is a linked list of disk blocks and the blocks may be scattered anywhere on the disk.\nAdvantages:\n- Simple as only need starting address\n- No wasted space and no constraint on file size\nDisadvantages:\n- No random access\n*Assuming 4 bytes is reserved for the pointer to the next block:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/seAqKqD.png)\nWhy displacement need to + 4? #question i think maybe the first 4 bytes is used for the pointer, so displacement needs to +4 to skip the pointer address.\n\u003e [! The delete operation]\n\u003e Deleting a data block stored with linked allocation requires an update to the connected pointer. \n\u003e *e.g. Delete data block 5 in a file with 10 data blocks*:\n\u003e 6 reads to reach block 5. 1 write to update the pointer of block 4 to block 6\n#### Indexed allocation\nEach file has an index block which contains all pointers to the allocated blocks. Directory entry contains the block number of the index block. Similar to a [page table](Notes/Memory%20Organisation.md#^b8969e) for memory allocation.\nAdvantages:\n- Supports random access\n- Dynamic storage allocation without external fragmentation\nDisadvantages:\n- Overhead in keeping index blocks\n- Internal fragmentation as the last block that the index is pointing to may not be fully utilised\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1sYk7IS.png)\n\u003e [! The delete operation]\n\u003e Deleting a data block stored with indexed allocation requires an update to the indexed pointers. \n\u003e *e.g. Delete data block 5 in a file with 10 data blocks*:\n\u003e 1 read for the index block, 4 writes to update pointers \n#### inode\nAn inode is an index block. For each file and directory there is an inode. The inode contains file attributes, 12 pointers to direct blocks (data blocks) and 3 pointers point to indirect blocks (index blocks) with 3 levels of indirection.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0t64Mny.png)\nIndirection allows the system to support large file sizes:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zFuqkwv.png)\nUsing the inode:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XzcIDIN.png)\n## Directories\n### Structure\nA directory can be structured in two ways:\n1. each entry contains a file name and other attributes\n2. each entry contains a file name and a pointer to another data structure where file attributes can be found\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n5wb4w0.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qw4qB6W.png)\n\u003e [!Disk reads when navigating a directory]\n\u003e Assume that root directory is in memory\n\u003e Open(“/usr/ast/mbox”) will require 5 disk reads\n\u003e 1. load inode of “usr”  \n\u003e 2. load data block of “usr” (i.e., directory “usr”)  \n\u003e 3. load inode for “ast”  \n\u003e 4. load data block of “ast” (i.e., directory “ast”)  \n\u003e 5. load inode for “mbox”\n### Tree Structured\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7FbJ3PU.png)\nPath Name\n- Absolute Path Name: begins at the root and follows a path down to the specific file, e.g., /spell/mail/prt/first\n- Relative Path Name: Defines a path from the current directory, e.g. current directory is: /spell/mail relative path name for the above file is: prt/first\nCharacteristics:\n- Efficient Searching: File can be easily located according to the path name.\n- Naming: Files can have the same name under different directories.\n- Grouping: files can be grouped logically according to their properties\n### Acyclic Graph Directories\nThe tree structure prohibits sharing of files or directories while an acyclic graph allows this. It is a natural generalisation of the tree structure.\n#### Links as a UNIX implementation\nA link is a directory entry which is a poitner to another file or subdirectory\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XBiK2Ib.png)\n- A hard link points to the data on storage, while a soft link can point to another link which points to information on storage.\n- Both linking strategies allow a separate file name to be used for the source file name. This source file name will resolve to the target file data by following the link.\n![500](https://i.imgur.com/1kMzyvA.png)\n#### What happens on deletion?\nOne possibility is to remove the file whenever anyone deletes it, but this action may leave dangling pointers to the now-nonexistent file. Worse, if the remaining file pointers contain actual disk addresses, and the space is subsequently reused for other files, these dangling pointers may point into the middle of other files.\nSoft links\n- Search for liks and remove them: expensive unless a list of links is kept with the file OR\n- Leave the links and remove them only when trying to access them\nHard links\n- Preserve file unless all references are deleted. A count to the number of references is maintained in the file (a new link ++, deleting a link--). \n#### Why not just duplicate the file?\nDuplicate directory entries make the original and the copy indistinguishable. A major problem with this is maintaining consistency when a file is modified\n## Disk Space Management\nBlock size affects both data rate and disk space utilisation\n- Big block size: file fits into few blocks resulting in fast to find \u0026 transfer blocks, but wastes space if file does not occupy the entire last block\n- Small block size: file may consist of many blocks resulting in slow data rate\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ozMKoK9.png)\n### Managing Free Blocks\nThere is a need to track which blocks are free in order to allocate disk space to files\n#### Bitmap\nEach block is represented by 1 bit, 1 (free) and 0 (allocated)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3T1eJaE.png)\nAdvantage:\n- Simple and efficient to find the first free block via bit manipulation. i.e. Find the first non-0 word, and find the first bit 1 in the word.\nDisadvantage:\n- Takes up additional space as each block requires 1 bit\n- Inefficient to look up this bitmap unless the entire map is kept in memory\n#### Linked list\n![](https://i.imgur.com/habWC4G.png)\nThe pointer to the next block is stored in the block itself, hence to read the entire list, each block must be read sequentially requiring substantial I/O time.\n## Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q4C26Gf.png)\na. False. Owner and the group which owner belongs to is able to read.\nb. False. The OFT caches the FCB rather than the data block.\nc. False. Using linked file allocation, any free data block can be used.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3BDfuQU.png)\na. The previous links will now point to the data of the new file. To avoid this, dangling links need to be cleaned up.\nb. \nSingle copy\n- Race conditions, mutual exclusion\nMultiple copy\n- Storage waste\n- Inconsistency\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VEuDidH.png)\na. 5 disk accesses\n1. Load inode of usr\n2. Load directory for usr\n3. Load inode for ast\n4. Load directory for ast\n5. Load inode for mbox\nb. Seek: no disk reads needed\nCurrent position is 5900: Logical block 5, byte 900.\nread(100): 1 disk read by following direct pointer\nread(200): 2 disk read by following single indirect pointer\n3 disk reads total\nc. \nNumber of pointers in 1 index block = $1000/2=500$\nFile size supported = $(6+500) \\times 1000=506,000B$\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VB9xuM7.png)\nFile data can be stored across different physical storage blocks. A smaller physical block helps to reduce internal fragmentation as the last block occupied by the file can is only 512B compared to 4KB. Using the larger block size would also help to improve throughput.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/First-Order-Logic":{"title":"First Order Logic","content":"# First Order Logic\n[Propositional Logic](Notes/Propositional%20Logic.md) can only deal with a finite number of propositions:\n\nT: Tommy is faithful\nJ: Jimmy is faithful\nL: Laika is faithful\n$All\\ dogs\\ are\\ faithful\\iff T\\land J\\land L$ \nWhat if there is an infinite/unknown number of dogs?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cv3VDgZ.png)\n\n### Forming FOL sentences\n“All dogs are mammals\"\nGeneral form:  $\\forall xDog(x)\\implies Mammal(x)$\nUse conjunction? $\\forall x Dog(x) \\land Mammal(x)$ : **this is means everything is a dog and a mammal!**\n\n\"John owns a dog\"\nGeneral form: $\\exists x Dog(x)\\land Owns(John,x)$\nUse implication? $\\exists xDog(x)\\implies Owns(John,x)$: **this can mean that John owns things which are not dogs as well**\n\n### Inference Rules\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u2fblRM.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SEjFjs7.png)\n\nUsing substitutions is also called _Generalized Modus Ponens_.\nThe substitution used is called the _unifier_.\n\n### Getting to CNF\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oQcOri5.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ao7wmqA.png)\n\n\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n  \\exists xStudent(x)\\land \\neg Takes(x,AI)\\tag1\\equiv Student(K)\\land\\neg Takes(K,AI) \\\\\n  \\tag2 \\exists xStudent(x)\\land Takes(x,AI)\\land\\neg pass(x,AI)\\equiv \\\\\n  Student(F)\\land Takes(F,AI)\\land \\neg pass(F,AI)\\tag3\\\\\n   \\forall x,y \\neg Student(x)\\lor\\neg pass(x,y)\\lor\\neg hard(y)\\lor diligent(x)\\models\\\\\\tag4\\neg Student(x)\\lor\\neg pass(x,y)\\lor\\neg hard(y)\\lor diligent(x) \\\\\n   3+4:\\neg pass(x,y)\\lor\\neg hard(y)\\lor diligent(x)\\tag5 \\\\\n   \\tag6 3+4+5: Takes(x,AI)\\lor\\neg hard(AI)\\\\\n   6+Subst\\{x/K\\}\\ Takes(K,AI)\\lor\\neg hard(y)\\tag7\\\\\n   1+7: \\neg hard(AI)\\tag8\\\\\n   8+iv:\\emptyset\n  \\end{align}$$\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/GPU-Architecture":{"title":"GPU Architecture","content":"# GPU Architecture\nThe general purpose CPU is designed for single-threaded code optimised for *low latency.* The GPU allows us to achieve higher throughput in exchange for *higher latency.*\n\nNeed to achieve massive data parallelism for computing tasks such as vector processing and Multiplication and Accumulation (MAC) operations in matrices.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/48iqtPk.png)\nSIMD: Single instruction multiple data\n## CUDA\n### Architecture\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bY9kIUJ.png)\n### Programming Model\nCUDA works on a heterogeneous programming model that consists of a host and device.

We can create 1 block with 3 threads to achieve parallelism: `vector_add_cu\u003c\u003c\u003c1,3\u003e\u003e\u003e(d_c, d_a, d_b);`\nUse the threadIdx to access the memory:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d70gRtX.png)\n\u003e [! Threads vs Blocks]\n\u003e The example can also be achieved using 3 blocks each with 1 thread. However, parallel threads have the advantage to directly communicate and synchronise with each other due to shared hardware. Sharing memory between blocks would require *global memory access*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5vxKQ9c.png)\n### Example\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B5iK4Ky.png)\n```c++\n//initialize 1 block and 3 threads.

Each core can only execute 1 thread.\n- Each block of threads can be scheduled on any available SM by the runtime system, but 1 block can only exist on 1 SM.\n#### Warps\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ObcIEOG.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ENSz0mN.png)\n#### SIMT\nWarps enable a unique architecture called Single Instruction Multiple Thread. This means each warp executes only one common instruction for all threads.\n\nWithin a single thread, its instructions are\n- pipelined to achieve instruction-level parallelism\n- issued in order, with no branch prediction and speculative execution\nIndividual threads in a warp start together, at the same instruction address\n- but each has its own instruction address counter and registers\n- free to branch and execute independently when the thread diverges, such as due to data-dependent conditional execution and branch.\n#### Thread Divergence\nBranch statements will result in some threads in a warp wasting their clock cycles. This is because the threads in the warp must all execute the same instruction. For some which satisfy the condition, computation is done else NOP.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D0DNFIi.png)\n## Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zf3Aapc.png)\n```c\n__global__ void stencil(int N, int *input, int *output) {\n\tblockNum = blockIdx.x;\n\ti = threadIdx.x + blockNum * N;\n\tint sum = input[i];\n\tfor(int i = 1; i \u003c 3; i++) {\n\t\tsum += input[i-i]\n\t\tsum += input[i+i]\n\t}\n}\nint N = len(input) / BLOCK_SIZE\noutput = (int *) malloc(N * sizeof(int))\nstencil\u003c\u003c\u003cN, BLOCK_SIZE\u003e\u003e\u003e(N, input, output)\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Game-Theory":{"title":"Game Theory","content":"# Game Theory\n__Any game with a finite number of actions will have a Nash Equilibrium__\n\nPure Strategy set: a Nash equilibrium pure strategy exists if there are states which no party can gain a higher utility by choosing a separate action given that the other parties adhere to their current action.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MXygbV3.png)\n\nMixed Strategy set: __when there is no pure strategy, an equilibrium must exist in mixed strategies.__ It is a probability distribution over 2 or more pure strategies.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oyvCCDO.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.492165071Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Games-as-Search-Problems":{"title":"Games as Search Problems","content":"![](https://i.imgur.com/CZ3e50G.png)\n\nPerfect information also means *fully observable* unlike in Poker where you cannot see the opponent's hand.\n\n## Minimax Search\nMaximize own utility and minimize opponent's\n\n1.

Contiguous file allocation is best as the data being read is the entire file. If this entire file is stored contiguously, the time needed for the disk to access the data is minimised.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/elRvkyd.png)\na. Not necessarily, if requests are issued one at a time, the disk driver has no opportunity for SCAN optimisation (SCAN = FCFS). This can be solved by concurrently generating IO requests.\nb. Under light load, the overhead for scheduling might become greater than the average seek time. ~~Performance of a disk scheduling algorithm can be affected based on the file allocation system utilised. For example, a SCAN algorithm on a linked file allocation method would have poor performance. In linked file allocation, the data blocks accessed are located all over different sectors in the disk. This means that a complete file access operation might require the operation to wait for the disk arm to move from one end to the other.~~\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rzvq9fN.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kZDIjOP.png)\n~~Seek order: 4,10,23,35,35,40,45,50,70,132\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\u0026\\text{Single cylinder seek time}=20.1ms\\\\\n\u0026\\text{Total seek time}=(4+6+13+12+5+5+5+20+52)\\times20.1=2452.2ms\\\\\n\u0026\\text{Total rotational latency and transfer time}=(8+2)\\times10=100ms\\\\\n\u0026\\text{Average time}=2452.2+100=2552.2ms\n\\end{align}\n$$\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Index-Based-Algorithms":{"title":"Index Based Algorithms","content":"# Index Based Algorithms\nHaving an index on 1 or more attributes of a relation makes some algorithms more feasible.\n\u003e[! ] $V(R,a)$\n\u003eThis represents the number of distinct values of an attribute $a$ in a relation _R_\n\u003e\n## Index Based Selection\nFor a given selection operation $\\sigma_{a=v}(R)$ (_meaning select all tuples in R where attribute a = v_) we can use an index on attribute a to gain cost savings.\n### Clustered Index\nSince each tuple with the same attribute value are packed in as little blocks as possible, a clustered index will have savings averaging: \n$$IO =B(R)/V(R,a)$$\nThe actual value can be higher due to:\n1.

OS decides which partition to assign a process to depending on the available partitions. \n![400x400](https://i.imgur.com/8l3OiKG.png)\n*Internal fragmentation*: as each partition is fixed, a process assigned to a partition might not take up the entire space of the partition, resulting in wasted unusable memory internal to the partition. \n### Dynamic partitioning\nDo not partition the memory. Rather, the OS allocates the exact chunk of memory which a process requires, and keeps tracks of *holes* or available blocks of memory.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vEdUH9c.png)\n*External fragmentation*: memory space between partitions (the holes) may be enough to satisfy a new request but is not contiguous and cannot be used. This can be solved by performing compaction, which shuffles memory contents to produce contiguous block of available memory.\n### Dynamic Allocation Policies\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QYCVh9D.png)\n## Paging\n^b8969e\nAllow process to be allocated physical memory whenever it is available. \n\u003e [!Idea:]\n\u003e 1. Divide the physical memory into fixed sized *frames*.\n\u003e 2. Divide logical memory of the **process** into *pages* the same size as frames.\n\u003e 3. Use a page table to map the logical memory to physical memory.\n### Fragmentation\n- Eliminating external fragmentation as every available physical memory space can be utilised. \n- Internal fragmentation still possible as the last page may not use up the entire frame.\n### Address Translation\nSplit the logical address to map page to frame:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3pFbZJN.png)\nOffset necessary to locate the byte-addressable piece of physical memory.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QPaWk69.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zOHdEXK.png)\n### Hardware Support\nThe page table is stored in main memory with a page table base register (PTBR) pointing to it.\n#### Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLB)\nThe page table is stored in memory and thus, to access a piece of physical memory, we require 1 memory access to the page table and 1 memory access to the actual memory. We can speed this up with a specialised cache for the page table.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YdHgJgB.png)\n#### Effective access time\nWith TLB:\n- 1 TLB access and 1 mem access on hit\n- 1 TLB access and 2 mem access on miss\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0yZp2Q.png)\n### Shared Pages\nReentrant or code which never changes during execution can be shared among processes by having processes used the same pages.\n![500x500](https://i.imgur.com/A6xWe1W.png)\n### Multi-level Paging\nA page table can be large. Not efficient to have to fetch the entire page table for every memory LOAD/STUR instruction.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7pH5hvu.png)\n#### Paging the page table\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xllezzl.png)\n- Final level represents the physical memory space, 12 bits is needed for byte-addressing the 4KB memory. This leaves 20 bits for indexing pages.\n- Second level represents the index to the first level page: There are $2^{20}$ pages. Each page in this level is 4 bytes so as to map to the address of a 4byte page address.  \n- The root level represents the index to the 2nd level page: Since 1 block can store 4KB, to store information about the 4MB page table in 1 block will require $2^{20}\\times4/2^{12}=2^{10}$ entries\nHence, 10 bits to access 1 out of $2^{10}$ pages which itself contains 10 bits to access 1 out of $2^{10}$ pages. Total of $2^{20}$ pages.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dhOBFTt.png)\n### Inverted Page Table\n\u003e [! Idea:]\n\u003e Rather than each process having its own page table, we only keep a single table with 1 entry for each physical frame.\n\u003e 1. Each entry contains the `process-id` and `page-number` \n\u003e 2. To find a matching entry for a logical address, we need to find the entry that has the equivalent proces_id and page_number pair\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1syY6Pr.png)\nWe gain in terms of memory, as we no longer have a page table size that is proportional to logical addressing space. We lose in terms of speed, as we need to search the page table rather than addressing it directly with a page index.\n## Non Contiguous Allocation (Segmentation)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r7Z4FUg.png)\n### Addressing\nSimilar logic as with a regular paging scheme:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eTJ6naG.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KECm1QL.png)\n### Fragmentation\n- *External fragmentation*: as processes leave the system, occupied segments become holes in the memory\n## Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YwvOJ6S.png)\n\n![600](Pics/Memory%20Organisation%202022-10-10%2023.41.06.excalidraw.md)\nc.

Equivalently:\n- There is a polynomial time reduction from an NP-Complete problem G to D. _Since all problems in NP can be reduced to G in polynomial time, G is also reducible to D in polynomial time_.\n\n## Example reductions\n_Show that the [Longest Path Problem](Notes/Longest%20Path%20Problem.md) is NP-Hard_.\n\nReduction from the [Travelling Salesman Problem](Notes/Travelling%20Salesman%20Problem.md): For a weighted complete graph G with non negative weights, the path that passes through all the vertices once must also be one of the longest paths because the longest path must include all vertices. Forgo the shortest path optimization in TSP and we obtain LPP.\n\nReduction from the [Hamiltonian Path Problem](Hamiltonian%20Path%20Problem): For an unweighted graph G, it has a Hamiltonian path if and only if its longest path has length n − 1, where n is the number of vertices in G. Because the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete, this reduction shows that the decision version of the longest path problem is also NP-complete. In this decision problem, the input is a graph G and a number k; the desired output is \"yes\" if G contains a path of k or more edges, and no otherwise.\n\n## Too hard...use greedy heuristics\n- [](Notes/Knapsack%20Problem.md#Greedy%20Heuristics)\n- [](Notes/Travelling%20Salesman%20Problem.md#Greedy%20Heuristics)\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Page-Replacement-Policies":{"title":"Page Replacement Policies","content":"# Page Replacement Policies\n## First In First Out\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f6t69Lk.png)\n## [Least Recently Used Policy](Notes/Least%20Recently%20Used%20Policy.md)\n## [Clock (or Second Chance) Policy](Notes/Clock%20(or%20Second%20Chance)%20Policy.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Pipelining":{"title":"Pipelining","content":"# Pipelining\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q5XIG5f.png)\n## Datapath\nPipelining makes use of extra registers between each pipeline in order to store the necessary data and control signals needed by the current instruction for the next stage.

Also note that, if both processes can be executing in their critical sections at the same time, then flag[0] == flag[1] == true. These two observations imply that P0 and P1 could not have successfully executed their while statements at about the same time, since the value of turn can be either 0 or 1 but cannot be both. Hence, one of the processes—say, Pj —must have successfully executed the while statement, whereas Pi had to execute at least one additional statement (“turn == j”). However, at that time, flag[j] == true and turn == j, and this condition will persist as long as Pj is in its critical section; as a result, mutual exclusion is preserved.\nProgress:\n- Pi can be prevented from entering the critical section only if it is stuck in the while loop with the condition flag[j] == true and turn == j\n- If Pj is not ready to enter the critical section, then flag[j] == false, and Pi can enter its critical section. If Pj has set flag[j] to true and is also executing in its while statement, then either turn == i or turn == j. If turn == i, then Pi will enter the critical section. If turn == j, then Pj will enter the critical section.\nBounded Waiting:\n- When $P_i$ exits its critical section, flag[j] == false and $P_i$ is allowed to enter its critical section. Assume $P_j$ resets flag[j] == true, it will subsequently set turn == i. Since $P_i$ cannot change the turn value while in the loop, it is allowed to enter the critical section after at most 1 entry by $P_j$\n## Hardware Solution\n### Synchronization Hardware\nRace condition is a result of context switches. We can prevent that in hardware to have atomic instructions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gJrBVWr.png)\n*Difficult to control the disabling of context switches in user level as there may be many critical regions and regions execute for unknown amounts of time*\nTestAndSet is now an assembly instruction which can be used to acquire a lock:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ML23PqH.png)\n- No context switches can occur while setting the lock value\n- This means that whoever runs this instruction first will run first, no other process will be able to enter critical region\n- If lock == true, someone is in the critical section: we are blocked\n- If lock == false, we set lock to true and move into the critical section\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zwFGrJq.png)\nHardware has no memory of process trying to access the lock. P0 able to indefinitely take the lock without giving P1 a chance.\n## Operating System Solution\n### Mutex Locks\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pLZl78y.png)\n### Semaphore\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NFRVyYv.png)\n- A binary sempahore behaves similar to mutex locks.\n- A counting semaphore is used to control access to a given resource consisting of a finite number of instances. **It is initalised to the number of resources available**.\n#### Busy waiting *solution*\nAlso known as a *spinlock*, where a thread trying to acquire a lock is caused to wait in a loop (\"spin\") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aPAwIXL.png)\nAtomicity is not possible for this solution on a single-core. If a process P0 must loop to execute `Wait(S)`, no other processes can execute `Signal(S)` in order to allow P0 to continue. If we cannot context switch then there is no solution.\n#### Blocking Solution\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tiVca7I.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IgHj0f5.png)\n- Process is in the waiting state because the process cannot use the CPU (and following which enter its critical section) if another process is currently in its critical section\n- Process woken up is changed to ready state but the CPU may not switch from the currently running process to this newly ready process depending on scheduling\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mc1Ihj1.png)\nAtomicity needed for these system calls:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YRNgQVD.png)\n## Classical Problems of Synchronization\n### Bounded Buffer\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y7Jf4tR.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1R40zE1.png)\nThe order of access to the shared variables matter. Logically, each process should check if the resource is available (in the case of consumer) OR if there is currently no instances (for producers), before trying to access the buffer through the mutex lock.\nProducer:\n```go\ndo \n{\n    // wait until empty \u003e 0 and then decrement 'empty'\n    wait(empty);   \n    // acquire lock\n    wait(mutex);  \n    \n    /* perform the insert operation in a slot */\n    \n    // release lock\n    signal(mutex);  \n    // increment 'full'\n    signal(full);   \n} \nwhile(TRUE)\n```\nConsumer:\n```go\ndo \n{\n    // wait until full \u003e 0 and then decrement 'full'\n    wait(full);\n    // acquire the lock\n    wait(mutex);  \n    \n    /* perform the remove operation in a slot */ \n    \n    // release the lock\n    signal(mutex); \n    // increment 'empty'\n    signal(empty); \n} \nwhile(TRUE);\n```\n### Dining Philosophers\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xeUVrNj.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zTf3nWu.png)\n- If each process executes the first `wait(chopstick)` and context switches, every process only has 1 chopstick and is stuck in a deadlock\nSolutions:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q9Gp6b0.png)\n### Readers-Writers\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mobJGtN.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/23qQMhV.png)\nWriter:\n```go\nwait(wrt);\n//write\nsignal(wrt);\n```\n#### Second Readers-Writers Problem\nIt is possible that a reader _R1_ might have the lock, a writer _W_ be waiting for the lock, and then a reader _R2_ requests access. It would be unfair for _R2_ to jump in immediately, ahead of _W_; if that happened often enough, _W_ would [starve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_starvation \"Resource starvation\"). Instead, _W_ should start as soon as possible.

However, to know the cost of an operator often requires the input sizes to be known. This is often not available for intermediary operators which are executed after other operators such as `SELECT` are done.\nAssumptions:\n1. Uniform distribution of values in domain\n2. Independent distribution of values in different columns\n3. Independence of predicates for select and join\n![](https://i.imgur.com/69FO4mE.png)\n#### Estimating Selection\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kLBr1UB.png)\n3 is used as an intuition for how a range operation would usually return less than half of all the tuples.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vQPnDLO.png)\nFor negation, we can estimate all tuples in the relation to satisfy the condition. Alternatively, notice that the number of distinct tuples that satisfy the relation is equal to $V(R,A)-1$\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kqmLVen.png)\nNotice that the equation relates to converting an OR relation into an equivalent AND notation. $A|B=!(!A \\cap !B)$  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/oVNvTd7.png)\n#### Estimating Joins\nAssumptions:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c5Vnm56.png)\n- Containment of value: satisfied when Y is a key in S and the corresponding foreign key in R. Approximately true due to probability since if Y appears in S, it is likely to appear in R as well since S is large.\n- Preservation: violated when there are tuples in R which join with no tuples in S.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y5mkPC7.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EAwXdkf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oPDMzqE.png)\n#### Using Statistics\nThe assumption of uniform distribution is not accurate since real data is not uniformly distributed.\nWe can maintain a histogram for each relation to help us improve the estimation:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PcMR1ga.png)\nStatistics from each bucket can be used to determine the number of tuples in a range:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HPXoFGg.png)\nExample:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tou8AKE.png)\nExample for join:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1iQ4kdj.png)\nSampling can be used to increase performance:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lE0yNfb.png)\n### Join Order Selection\nMany  [](Notes/Two%20Pass%20Algorithms.md#Sort-Merge%20Join%7Cjoin%20algorithms) are asymmetric, the role played by the two argument relations are different and the cost depends on which relation plays which role. \n- Build relation: the relation stored in main memory\n- Probe relation: relation which is read a block at a time to match the tuples in the build relation\n*Assumptions: the left argument is the build relation and the right argument is the probe relation*\nAs the number of relations involved in the query increases, the number of possible join orders increases rapidly. We can use *join trees* to represent each of these possibilities:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEfAxlR.png)\n#### Left-deep tree\nIt has a few advantages that make it a good default option:\n- The number of possible left-deep trees with a given number of leaves is  large, but not nearly as large as the number of all trees. Thus, searches  for query plans can be used for larger queries if we limit the search to  left-deep trees. \n- Left-deep trees for joins interact well with common join algorithms —  nested-loop joins and one-pass joins in particular. \n- Intermediate results are not written to temporary files.\nExample from the above image:\n*Left-deep tree*:\n1. Right children are the probe relations, we start building the join from the left leaf node R3\n2. We keep R3 in main memory and perform R3 $\\Join$ R1. This uses B(R) + B($R3\\Join R1$) buffers\n3. No need to keep R3 in main memory anymore, can use the space to store the result from B($R3\\Join R1\\Join R5$).\n*Right-deep tree*:\n1. R3 is the build relation from the root, load R3 into memory\n2. Need $R3\\Join R1\\Join R5\\Join R2\\Join R4$ as the probe relation. To compute this, we need R1 to be loaded into main memory to compute $R1\\Join R5\\Join R2\\Join R4$ as the probe relation.\n3. So on and so forth...\nThe right-deep tree will require alot more space for the intermediate relations.\n### Join Algorithm Selection\n#### Heuristics\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BXJGc0o.png)\n#### Dynamic Programming\nSince we are concerned about minimising the cost of the query plan, we can utilise [DP](003%20Dynamic%20Programming.md) to remember the costs at each intermediate step for each enumeration. **The cost is the size of the intermediate relation.**\nExample:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fVflcof.png)\n![400](https://i.imgur.com/VzFz2K9.png)\nThe cost for 2 relations is still 0, as no intermediate results are generated:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gKWxzfs.png)\nThere are $4\\choose{3}$ ways to select 3 out of 4 of the relations. If we only consider left-deep trees, each option has $3\\choose2$ permutations. We use the cost of the double relations to find the min cost of each permutation.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NVT9vIg.png)\nFinally, when we consider all 4 relations, there are only 4 permutations if we only select left-deep trees. That is $4\\choose2$$\\times$ $2\\choose1$.

Generate new version of database\n## SQL Transactions\n- A new transaction starts with `BEGIN`\n- Transactions are stopped with either a `COMMIT` or `ABORT`\n- `COMMIT`: changes are saved\n- `ABORT`: changes are undone\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rc3m2AF.png)\n## ACID Properties\n### Atomicity\nA transaction is either performed in its entirety (can be in steps) or not performed at all.\n#### Logging\nDBMS logs all actions so that it can undo the actions of aborted transactions\n#### Shadow paging\nMake copies of pages, perform changes on these copies. Only when transaction commits, the page is made visible to others.\n### Consistency\n#### Database consistency\nA database is in consistent state if it obeys all of the consistency (integrity) constraints defined over it. A database may be inconsistent in between states.\n#### Transaction consistency\nDatabase is in consistent state even if there are a number of concurrent transactions\n### Isolation\nA transaction should appear as though it is executed in isolation from other transactions. An executing transaction cannot reveal its results to other concurrent transactions before its commitment.\n#### Concurrency control protocol\n- Pessimistic: Do not let problems arise in the first place (prevention)\n- Optimistic: Assume conflicts are rare and deal with them when they happen (detection and recovery)\n### Durability\nChanges applied to the database by a committed transaction must persist in the database.\n## Primitive Operations\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O5iaevr.png)\n## Failures\n### Types of Failures\n#### Transaction failures\n- Logical Errors: Transaction cannot complete due to some internal error condition (e.g., integrity constraint violation).\n- Internal State Errors: DBMS must terminate an active transaction due to an error condition (e.g., deadlock).\n#### System failures\n- Software Failure: Problem with the DBMS implementation (e.g., uncaught divide-by-zero exception).\n- Hardware Failure: The computer hosting the DBMS crashes (e.g., power plug gets pulled, disk crash). They can be recoverable or non-recoverable\n## Recovery Algorithms\nRecovery must kick in to ensure the database satisfies the ACID properties in the case of failure. They must carry in 2 parts:\n1. Actions during normal transaction processing to ensure that the DBMS can recover from a failure.\n2. Actions after a failure to recover to a state that ensures atomicity, consistency and durability\n\n\u003e Ensuring atomicity and durability -- Logging:\n\u003e The database stores additional files called *log files*. Logs record every action of each transaction and are append only.\n### Undo Logging\nIdea: undo the effects of transactions that may not have completed before failure.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/805J1ia.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TECxSmC.png)\n\u003e [!Rules]\n\u003e With undo logging, there are a set of rules the DBMS must follow. Order of writing to disk:\n\u003e 1. Log records indicating changed database elements\n\u003e 2. Changed database elements themselves\n\u003e 3. COMMIT log record\n#### Recovery without checkpoints\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9i2OUpZ.png)\nAll undo commands are idempotent, if failure occurs during recovery, we can simply restart.\n#### Checkpointing\nUse periodic checkpoints to prevent having to read the entirety of the log file for recovery. Any transactions executed before the checkpoint will have finished and there will be no need to undo them.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z54jfvB.png)\nProblem\n- The database is frozen while performing checkpointing. Active transactions may take a long time to commit or abort and will result in variant performance of the DBMS.\n#### Non-quiescent Checkpointing\nStart checkpointing at any time using the current incomplete transactions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3uaHcFg.png)\n#### Recovery with checkpoints\n1. Scan backwards identifying transactions which did not commit.\n2. If we reach END CKPT, we know that the only transactions which may not have committed must be those after the `START CKPT`. Thus, we can stop at `START CKPT`\n3. If we reach `START CKPT` first, we failed during checkpointing and need to search up till the earliest `START T` of those in the checkpoint, because we know those are the transactions active at the start of the checkpoint \n4. Undo uncommitted transactions and ignore those that have committed.\n#### Limitations\nCannot commit a transaction without first writing all its changed data to disk. This means we will need many disk I/O for each transaction.\n### Redo Logging\nDo not write all changed data to disk before committing. Write to the main memory log file all the changes to the DB, and commit before any changes are written to disk. Perform recovery by redoing effects of committed transactions before the crash.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zhule0H.png)\n\u003e [!Rules]\n\u003e If a transaction modifies X, then both \u003cT,x,v\u003e and COMMIT T must be written to disk before OUTPUT(X). Order of writing to disk:\n\u003e 1. Log records indicating the changed elements\n\u003e 2. COMMIT T log record\n\u003e 3. Changes to the elements themselves\n#### Recovery without checkpoints\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WuYLOdQ.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RMa262e.png)\n#### Checkpointing\nStart checkpointing for all active transactions. When we see an `START CHECKPOINT`, we can be sure that all prior transactions have been recorded to the disk and there is no need to redo them. \n*Example where we do not need to redo the actions for T1:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MCReHYm.png)\n#### Recovery with checkpoints\n1. If we see a `END CHKPT` in the log, we can be sure that changes made by transactions that have committed before the `START CHKPT` is already in disk, and we can ignore them. If no `END CKPT` in logs, we need to search back to next to last `START CKPT`.\n2. From `START CKPT (T1, ... Tk)` we *cannot* be sure that any transaction that is among the $T_i$ or those started after this checkpoint log have been written to disk. **We must search back until the earliest $T_i$ and redo.**\n3. However, if $T_i$ 's commit message is not found, we write `ABORT Ti` as it must not be redone.\n#### Limitations\nIt requires all modified blocks to be kept in buffers until the transaction commits and the log records have been flushed. This increases the average number of buffers needed by transactions.\n### Undo/Redo Logging\nIncrease flexibility by maintaining more information on the log. \u003cT,X,v,w\u003e now stores both old and new values in the log. \n\u003e [!Rule]\nBefore modifying any DB element X, the log record must be written to the disk.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3BiSNNV.png)\nWe can commit at any time after the \u003cT,B,8,6\u003e record has been written to the disk. \nRecovery process:\n1. Redo all committed transactions top-down\n2. Undo all uncommitted transactions bottom-up\nThis is because we may have committed transactions with some of the changes not on disk as well as uncommitted transactions with some of the changes on disk.\n#### Checkpointing\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WBdr1xt.png)\n- The `END CKPT` can appear anywhere after the `START CKPT`\n#### Recovery with checkpoints\nWe are sure we do not need to check any further than the `START TRANSACTION` of active transactions in the checkpoint as the corresponding `END CHECKPOINT` ensures that all changes prior to the `START` have been flushed to the disk.\n1. If crash occurs at the end, T2 and T3 are identified as committed and we redo actions starting from `START CKPT`\n2. If crash occurs before `COMMIT T3`, T2 is committed but. T3 is not. Redo T2 from `START CKPT` and undo T3 until `START T3`.\n3. If crash occurs before `END CKPT`, any changes made by previous transactions may not have been written to disk. We need to search back to the next to last `START CKPT`, redo committed transactions and undo incomplete ones up till their corresponding `START T` logs.\n## Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J2UHbco.png)\na.

It optimises for accurate delivery.\n## Three-way Handshake\nEvery TCP connection begins with a 3-way handshake:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yvkT1aC.png)\n- SYN: Client picks a random sequence number x and sends a SYN packet, which may also include additional TCP flags and options.\n- SYN ACK: Server increments x by 1 and picks own random sequence number for y, appends its own set of flags and options\n- ACK: Client increments both x and y by 1 and completes the handshake\n### Performance Implications\nThe client can send a data packet immediately after the ACK packet but the server must wait for the ACK packet before it can dispatch any data.\n\nEach new connection will have a full roundtrip of latency before any application data is transferred.\n### TCP Keep-Alive\nRather than having to complete 3-way handshake for each data transfer, allow long-lasting connections to immediately transfer application data.\n### TCP Fast Open (TFO)\nAllow data transfer within the SYN Packet.\n## Stateful: Order of transmission\nTCP is capable of transmitting messages spread across multiple packets without explicit information from the packets themselves.\n\nHow? TCP is stateful and connection state is allocated on both ends of the connection, allowing data to be sequenced, delivered in order and retransmitted when lost.\n## Congestion Control\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mmi1F8C.png)\n### Flow Control\nFlow control is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with data it may not be able to process—the receiver may be busy, under heavy load, or may only be willing to allocate a fixed amount of buffer space.\n#### Receive Window (rwnd)\nTransmit a receive window (rwnd) value in each ACK packet between both sides to communicate the size of available buffer space to hold incoming data.\n### Slow Start\nThe problem was that flow control prevented the sender from overwhelming the receiver, but there was no mechanism to prevent either side from overwhelming the underlying network: neither the sender nor the receiver knows the available bandwidth at the beginning of a new connection.\n\nIdea: Estimate available capacity by transmitting data. \n#### Congestion Window (cwnd)\nSender side limit on the amount of data the sender can have in flight before receiving and ACK from client. For every received ACK, cwnd doubles.\n### Performance Implications\nThe maximum amount of un-acked data is $min(rwnd, cwnd)$. The server can send up to that amount of network segments to the client at which point it must stop and wait for an acknowledgement.\n\nThe performance of the connection is often limited by the round trip time (latency) or the congestion window\nTime to reach a cwnd = N:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8i8jDM4.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bf30Siq.png)\n## Congestion Avoidance\nThe implicit assumption in congestion avoidance is that packet loss is indicative of network congestion: somewhere along the path we have encountered a congested link or a router, which was forced to drop the packet, and hence we need to adjust our window to avoid inducing more packet loss to avoid overwhelming the network.\n## Bandwidth Delay Product\nIf either the sender or receiver exceeds the maximum unacknowledged data, they will have to wait before they can send any more. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/tE0o5TM.png)\nTo maximize throughput, *send so much data that there is always an ACK returning back to the sender at the same time we are about to send a data packet*.\n$BDP = \\text{Data Link Capacity}\\times\\text{Round Trip Time}$\nExample, 10 Mbps available bandwidth and 100ms RTT\n$BDP=10\\times10^6\\times0.1=1\\times10^6$ bits\nThe window size needs to be at least this size to saturate the data link.\n## Head-of-Line Blocking\nIf one of the packets is lost en route to the receiver, then all subsequent packets must be held in the receiver’s TCP buffer until the lost packet is retransmitted and arrives at the receiver. Because this work is done within the TCP layer, our application has no visibility into the TCP retransmissions or the queued packet buffers, and must wait for the full sequence before it is able to access the data. Instead, it simply sees a delivery delay when it tries to read the data from the socket. \n\u003e[! Note]\n\u003eBenefits\n\u003e1.

Two pass algorithms are a class of algorithms used to break down data into chunks which fit into main memory where we can then apply operations.\n## Sort Based Algorithms\nIf data fits in memory, then we can use a standard sorting algorithm like quick-sort. If data does not fit in memory, then we need to use a technique that is aware of the cost of writing data out to disk.\n### External Merge Sort\nIdea is similar to [Merge Sort](Notes/Merge%20Sort.md). By breaking the data into pairs, we can sort each pair and merge them recursively.\nWe have 2 buffers for READ and 1 buffer for write: B(R) = 4\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iWVMUnT.png)\nSince each run may not fully fit inside memory, we can load segments of pairs of runs (e.g. 1 block from each run even though run contains 2 blocks), merge them and immediately write them back to the disk. \n### Two-Phase Multiway Merge Sort\nWe do not fully utilise all the buffers in external merge sort if M \u003e 3. \nIdea:\n1. Divide data into $\\frac{B}{M}$ sublists each of size $M$.\n2. Sort each chunk and write it back to the disk\n3. Use 1 input buffer for each sorted sublist. Implication: *hence there can only be M-1 sublists*\n\t1. Take the smallest of the head of each sublist (each in 1 buffer) and move into output\n\t2. If a buffer is empty: load tuples into the block from the same sorted sublist\n\t3. If no blocks remain in the sublist, ignore\n\u003e [! Note]\n\u003e Suppose R fits on B blocks. With M buffers each of 1 block, we can effectively sort M blocks of data each time. We can form $B(R)/M$ sorted sublists. In total we will only read and write B(R) blocks for this step.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since we need 1 input buffer to represent each head of a sublist, we will need $B(R)/M \\le(M-1), \\ or\\  B(R)\\le M\\times (M-1)\\approx M^2$\n\u003e\n\u003e E.g. Suppose blocks are 64K bytes, and we have one gigabyte of  main memory. Then we can afford M  of 16K. Thus, a relation fitting in B  blocks can be sorted as long as B is no more than $(16K)^2 = 2^{28}$. Since blocks  are of size $64K = 2^{14}$, a relation can be sorted as long as its size is no greater  than $2^{42}$ bytes, or 4 terabytes.  \n\nIf B(R) cannot be split into sublists of size M $i.e. B(R)/M \\ge M$, first split B(R) into  sublists of size $M(M-1)$. Apply 2PMMS to each of these $\\frac{B(R)}{M(M-1)}$ chunks to get M sorted sublists. This forms the input for a third pass to form a fully sorted relation.\n#### Cost\nLet B be the number of blocks. B disk I/O to read in the first pass. B disk I/O to write sorted sublists. B disk I/O to read sorted sublists in second pass. **Total 3B disk I/O**.\n### Sort-Merge Join\nIdea: If the tuples are sorted, we can more easily join them together\nAlgorithm:\n1. Sort R and S according to a key Y using 2PMMS\n2. Merge R and S using only 2 buffers, one for the current block of R and another for the current block of S.\n\t1. Find the least value of y that is currently at front of blocks R and S\n\t2. If y does not appear at the front of the other relation, remove the tuples with value y\n\t3. Else, find tuples from both relations having sort key y, If necessary, read blocks from R and S until we are sure that there are no more y's in either relation. **We can use up to M buffers for this purpose\n\t4. Output all the tuples that can be formed by joining these tuples\n\t5. If either relation has no more unconsidered tuples in main memory, reload the buffer for that relation\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n35JBo0.png)\n#### Implications\nTuples with a common value of the sort key from both relations together must fit in M blocks. Consider if there are more than M such tuples. We will not be able to load the needed tuples for joining in 1 pass.\n#### Cost\n3B disk I/O per relation in step 1 for sorting, 1B per relation additionally to write fully sorted back to disk\n1B disk I/O per relation in step 2\nTotal: $5(B(R) + B(S))$ disk I/O\n### Refined Sort-Merge Join\nNotice that in sort-merge join, the 2 relations are sorted first and then merged in distinct passes creating the greatest possible numbers of buffers available for joining tuples with common value.\n\nIf we do not need to worry about large number of tuples sharing common sort key, we can join the tuples in the merge phase of the sort:\n1. Created M sorted sublists using sort key Y\n2. Bring the first block of each sublist into a buffer\n3. Repeatedly find the smallest y value. Find tuples of both relations that have value y.\n#### Cost\nStep 1 will require 2 I/O per block in order to read, form the sorted sublists and write back to disk\nStep 2 will require 1 I/O per block in order to read and merge\nTotal: $3(B(R) + B(S))$ disk I/O\n#### Implications\nWe need all sorted sublists from both relations to be able to fit in memory. \nNumber of sorted sublists = $(B_R+B_S)/M$\n$(B_R+B_S)/M \\le M$\n$(B_R+B_S) \\le M^2$\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pbW2M5z.png)\n## Hash Based Algorithms\nIdea: hash the data into M buckets in order to fit into M main memory buffers for operations.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S5ERzLt.png)\n### Grace Hash Join\n1. Hash both relations to M-1 buckets using join key\n2. Join every pair of matching hash key buckets in 1 pass\n\t1. Load all the buckets of one relation into M - 1 buffers\n\t2. One by one, load buckets from the other relation and join\n#### Implications\nThe relation which smaller number of buckets must at least fit into M - 1 buffers.\n$min(\\frac{B(R)}{M-1}, \\frac{B(S)}{M-1}) \\le M-1 \\approx min(B(R),B(S))\\le M^2$\n#### Cost\nStep 1: 2 disk I/O per block to hash and write back to disk\nStep 2: 1 disk I/O per block as we read 1 block once only before joining\nTotal: $3(B(R) + B(S))$ disk I/O\n### Hybrid Hash Join\nWhat if the size of one of our relations is much smaller than the M? $B(S) \u003c\u003c M^2$\nWe can leave some buckets of S in memory without writing to disk such that we can join with B(R) immediately.\n1. Partition S into k buckets, keep $t$ buckets in memory and $k-t$ buckets in the disk\n2. Partition R into k buckets, first $t$ buckets are joined with S\n3. Join $k-t$ pairs of buckets\n#### Implications\nThe $t$ hash buckets saved in memory + the blocks for each head of each hash bucket written to disk must fit entirely in memory.\n$$t\\times\\frac{B(R)}{k}+k-t\\le M$$\n#### Cost\nAverage bucket size is $B(S)/k$.

Divide data into M-1 buffers\n2. Sort each buffer and write it back to the disk.\n3. 2nd pass: read all the sorted sublists into M-1 buffers\n4. Move the smallest of the heads of each sublist into the output if the max of the current output does not already contain this incoming value.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aFtQUQT.png)\na. M = 3.

Need all sorted sublists in buffer, and need 1 additional buffer to comb through R\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8RCdvQ.png)\n~~Yes. Only refined sort merge join has comparable cost. In this case, refined sort merge join will not be applicable as both relations share multiple common values of attribute Y. Hence we are not able to fully load all tuples with the same attribute value into M buffers.~~\nNo. Hash join works by partitioning the relations based on the distinct keys. Since there are very few distinct values of Y, there will be very little partitions. 2nd pass will not work well since each partition must be loaded fully into memory buffer.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8v4AFJU.png)\na.\nStrategy:\n1. Use R as the outer relation as it is smaller.\n2. Keep 1 hash bucket in memory.

Perform join on merge phase: $1(B_R + B_S)=20000$\nTotal = 60000 i/o\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hSue1Sr.png)\ni. The minimum number of main memory blocks needed is that the relation with smaller number of hashed blocks must fit entirely into the main memory.

Sort R and S according to the attribute $x$ using two phase multiway merge sort\n2. Load the first block of sorted R and S into main memory\n3. Find tuple with the smallest value of $x$ and find matching tuples and write them to the output buffer\n4. Repeatedly find the smallest value of $x$ once all tuples with the current smallest value are considered\n5.

Uncalled Functions:\n```typescript\nfunction flipCoin() {\n  // Meant to be Math.random()\n  return Math.random \u003c 0.5;\n  //Operator '\u003c' cannot be applied to types '() =\u003e number' and 'number'.\n}\n```\n2. Logic errors\n```typescript\nconst value = Math.random() \u003c 0.5 ? \"a\" : \"b\";\nif (value !== \"a\") {\n  // ...\n} else if (value === \"b\") {\n  //This condition will always return 'false' since the types '\"a\"' and '\"b\"' have no         \n  //overlap.\n  // Oops, unreachable\n}\n```\n## Defining Types\n#### Type Inference\n```typescript\nlet helloworld = \"Hello World\" //typescript uses the value as its type\n```\n\nThis is in contrast to Java which types have to be explicitly defined:\n```java\nString name = \"John\";\n```\n\n#### Type Aliases\nA name for any type\n```typescript\ntype Point = {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n};\n\ntype ID = number | string;\n```\n\n#### Type Interfaces\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n```\n\nOOP type annotations:\n```typescript\nclass UserAccount {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n \n  constructor(name: string, id: number) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n}\n \nconst user: User = new UserAccount(\"Murphy\", 1);\n```\n\n__An interface is always extendable but an alias is not open for extension:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ioFZmoM.png)\n\n## Composing Types\n#### Unions\n```typescript\ntype WindowStates = \"open\" | \"closed\" | \"minimized\";\n\ntype LockStates = \"locked\" | \"unlocked\";\n\ntype PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;\n\nfunction getLength(obj: string | string[]) {\n\treturn obj.length;\n}\n```\n\nTypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union. For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can’t use methods that are only available on string. Use `typeof \u003cx\u003e === \"\u003ctype\u003e\"` to check for types before calling type specific methods.\n\n#### Types with Generics\n```typescript\ninterface Backpack\u003cType\u003e {\n  add: (obj: Type) =\u003e void;\n  get: () =\u003e Type;\n}\n \n// This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a\n// constant called `backpack`, and to not worry about where it came from.\ndeclare const backpack: Backpack\u003cstring\u003e;\n \n// object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack.\nconst object = backpack.get();\n \n// Since the backpack variable is a string, you can't pass a number to the add function.\nbackpack.add(23);\n```\n## Structural Type System\n_In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type._\n\n```typescript\ninterface Point {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n}\n\nfunction logPoint(p: Point) {\n  console.log(`${p.x}, ${p.y}`);\n}\n\nconst point3 = { x: 12, y: 26, z: 89 };\nlogPoint(point3); // logs \"12, 26\"\n \nconst rect = { x: 33, y: 3, width: 30, height: 80 };\nlogPoint(rect); // logs \"33, 3\"\n \nconst color = { hex: \"#187ABF\" };\nlogPoint(color); //fails as x and y are missing\n\n```\n\nAn object need only to match all the type attributes for the code to pass (can have more but not less).\n\n\n\n## Type Assertions\nSometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can’t know about.\n\nFor example, if you’re using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return _some_ kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.\n\nIn this situation, you can use a _type assertion_ to specify a more specific type: `const myCanvas = document.getElementById(\"main_canvas\") as HTMLCanvasElement;`\n\nAngle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent: `const myCanvas = \u003cHTMLCanvasElement\u003edocument.getElementById(\"main_canvas\");`\n\n\u003e [!REMINDER] Runtime behaviour\n\u003e Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion. There won’t be an exception or `null` generated if the type assertion is wrong.\n\nTypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a _more specific_ or _less specific_ version of a type. This rule prevents “impossible” coercions like: `const x = \"hello\" as number;`\n\nThis rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid. You can use two assertions, first to `any` or `unknown`,then to the desired type:\n`const a = (expr as any) as T;`\n\n## Literal Types\nThe types used in the union above include some literals e.g. \"locked\", 1\n\n#### Literal Inference (or lack thereof):\nWhen you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later. \n\n`req.method` must have the type `string`, not `\"GET\"`:\n\n```typescript\nconst req = { url: \"https://example.com\", method: \"GET\" };\n\nhandleRequest(req.url, req.method); \n//error out as type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '\"GET\" | \"POST\"' for req.method.\n\n// Change 1:\n\nconst req = { url: \"https://example.com\", method: \"GET\" as \"GET\" };\n\n// Change 2\n\nhandleRequest(req.url, req.method as \"GET\");\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Uniform-Cost-Search":{"title":"Uniform Cost Search","content":"# Uniform Cost Search\nTake the full path cost to the node as g(n)\n\nTerminate when a goal node is found.\n\nOptimality: True for graph with nonnegative weights\n\nSimilar implementation to [Dijkstra's Algorithm](Notes/Dijkstra's%20Algorithm.md) but without computing shortest path for all nodes.\n### Graph Traversal\n![](https://i.imgur.com/syk9okN.png)\n\n_Assuming ties are handled in alphabetical order_\n\nExpansion Order:\nA \u003e B \u003e D \u003e E \u003e F \u003e G\nFinal Path:\nA \u003e B \u003e D \u003e E \u003e F \u003e G\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Union-Find":{"title":"Union Find","content":"# Union Find\nA data structure to represent dynamic equivalence relations\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fOnL8Vo.png)\n\n## Operations\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jhhDWZD.png)\n\nThese operations make it an efficient data structure to verify if a cycle exists in some __undirected__ graph.\n- Union find is unable to detect cycles in directed graphs: union operation cannot distinguish between the subcomponent that makes the edge from a -\u003e b and that which makes the edge b-\u003ea\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tv7KgtB.png)\n\n## Implementations\n### Quick Find\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Katri54.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eRsdZvR.png)\n\n#### Pseudocode\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c5Kl8s7.png)\n\n#### Complexity\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iGofEbN.png)\n\n### Quick Union\nUnions are too expensive using quick find, as we have to change the ids of all elements in the combining equivalence class for each union operation.\n\nImprovement: only store the parent of the node\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5Mf1OyA.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sB3ZACP.png)\n\n#### Pseudocode\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NHSHVgc.png)\n\n#### Complexity\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kIEBDNq.png)\n\n### Weighted Quick Union\nQuick Union creates possible tall trees as the union operation does not necessarily occur between root nodes.\n\nImprovement: avoid tall trees by linking smaller tree root to larger tree root\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5BJu8tg.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/311sffE.png)\n\n#### Pseudocode\n#### Complexity\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ea12VYk.png)\n\nHence, besides initialization $O(n)$, all other operations take $O(logn)$\n### WQU with Path Compression\nImprovement: further reduce the effective path to reach the root node: for some node p which we are computing the root of, we can update id[] of nodes on the path from p to root.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUlmrC9.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.496165119Z","tags":null},"/Notes/Use-Case-Diagrams":{"title":"Use Case Diagrams","content":"# Use Case Diagram\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ruK2Qlz.png)\n\n## Associations\n### extend\nThe **extending use case is dependent on the base use case**; it literally extends the behaviour described by the base use case.

Consequently, it quickly faults again, and again, and again, replacing pages that it must bring back in immediately. **This high paging activity is thrashing**.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/swSweEg.png)\nTo prevent thrashing, we must provide a process with as many frames as it needs.\n#### Working Set Model\nBased on the concept of locality of reference: processes tend to refer to pages in a localised manner\nTemporal locality: locations referred to recently are likely to be referenced again\nSpatial locality: code and data are usually clustered physically\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8KemQbT.png)\nImplementation:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6dzOR3i.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/64zPdG0.png)\nAdditional metrics:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hcbkUG6.png)\n#### Page Fault Frequency\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rnLcCTo.png)\n- Establish an upper and lower bound for acceptable page-fault rate and allocate and deallocate frames accordingly\n## Page Replacement\nIf there are no empty frames, OS needs to locate a victim to evict:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AfKxz30.png)\n### Belady's Anomaly\n![500](https://i.imgur.com/ubzcJYj.png)\n\u003e [!Inclusion Property]\n\u003e Pages loaded in *n* frames is always a subset of pages in *n+1* frames\n\u003e\n\u003e An algorithm does not suffer from Belady's anomaly if it satisfies the inclusion property. This is because such an algorithm will only increase its total coverage of available frames and does not replace any frame that was previously loaded.\n\u003e\n\u003e An example with FIFO:\n\u003e\n\u003e ![400](https://i.imgur.com/Z2DZRrv.png)\n### Policies\n[Page Replacement Policies](Notes/Page%20Replacement%20Policies.md)\n### Allocation of Frames\n#### Fixed allocation\nGive a process a fixed number of frames in memory for execution.\n#### Variable allocation\nAllow the number of frames allocated to the process to vary across its execution lifetime.\n### Scope of Replacement\n#### Global\nProcess selects a replacement frame from the set of all frames; one process can take a frame from another process. Implication: performance of the process depends on external processes.\n#### Local\nEach process selects only from its own set of allocated frame. Implication: may hinder other processes by not making available its less used pages/frames\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BEphKf6.png)\n## Other Considerations\n### Program Structure\nSpecific choice in data structures used and program structure can affect the performance of demand paging. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZSGI7sq.png)\n- Use of data structures like a hash set or linked list might offer *lesser* locality of reference than a data structure like an array, possibly reducing performance\n# Practice Problems\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4ukwOxR.png)\na. FIFO will replace the earliest loaded page. Page 2\nb. Replace the first page with R=0. Page 0.\nc. Replace the oldest accessed page.

I am Brendan, a computer science and business student from NTU and I am here today to share with you about my idea to equip every Singaporean with the opportunity to thrive.\n\nSingapore is increasing its emphasis on digitization for much of our core systems. In this year's National Day Rally, Prime Minister LHL gave an update on the Tuas Port. It will incorporate the use of Artificial Intelligence in order to streamline port services such as vessel traffic management and port clearance. Effective development and application of technology will allow it to support upwards of 65 million TEUs of cargo. (include some stats)\n\nMoreover, Mr Lee also spoke about the importance of top talent to the prosperity and success of SG's future. And without a doubt, building up home grown talent in the field of information technology will be key to sustaining the backbone of much of the services which keeps Singapore running. (maybe stats here is better?)\n\nTo achieve this, I believe that we must start young. Your ministry also believes the same, and have already started its own enrichment programme, Code For Fun, which offers a 10 hour curriculum focused on digital literacy to all primary and secondary school students. \n\nThis programme is a good start, but more needs to be done in terms of offering a more in-depth curriculum that is also widely available. Currently, one solution for children wanting to learn more is through external commercial centers which offers children focused coding programmes. \n\nHowever, this means that some children are being left behind. Underprivileged families, who may find these skills important but yet cannot afford to send their children for commercial classes are stuck. Here I would like to introduce my idea for KidsCode. Our slogan is creating opportunities through code and we want to to fill this gap by providing a free and in-depth curriculum for children of disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n_What will CITC do?_\nKidsCode will aim to develop computational thinking skills in the children that participate. Now what is computational thinking? Simply put, it is the ability to think like a computer. Fret not, this does not mean that we will be stifling the creative minds of our youth, but rather the opposite. Computational thinking is the ability to use logical and structured ways to break down difficult problems, and to encourage the use creativity to come up with novel solutions. \n\nAt the same time we aim to inculcate other important values such as resilience through guided mentorship, and confidence through project presentations.\n \n_types of classes_ (add Scratch example animation in Slide)\nTo begin with, we will offer 2 types of classes which will cater to different age groups. For 8-12 year olds, we will offer lessons in Scratch. Scratch is an introductory language which provides many inbuilt features for creating games and animations. This visual element is key to keeping younger kids engaged.\n\nFor 13-16 year olds, we will offer lessons in python, a simple yet extremely powerful programming language capable of building complex systems. This will provide natural progression for kids who are already more familiar with technology.\n\nKidsCode will run with the support of volunteers. We will start with volunteers from Singapore's local universities. Student interest groups with a passion for technology and wish to be part of the children's learning journey will form the backbone of our curriculum. As a technical director of NTU's Open Source Society, our team will be the first to take the lead to contribute to this initiative.\n\n_KidsCode schedule_\nKidsCode will run once a week, with each session being 1 hour long. I hope that such a schedule will provide a well-paced learning environment where the kids can take time to understand difficult concepts without adding too much pressure to their lifestyle.\n\nWith your support, we hope to expand KidsCode in 2 ways.\nFirstly, with increased funding, we want to provide training for our volunteers. This will allow us to accept volunteers with weaker technical backgrounds and increase our impact through greater manpower.\nSecondly, we hope that your support will unlock opportunities to work with key industry partners like Google. \n\nTo conclude, I would like to share a quote from Alvin Toffler, a famous American futurist. \"The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\" \nWe at KidsCode want to create an opportunity for those who are willing and capable to learn, unlearn and relearn, to thrive and to grow. Together, KidsCode can be that first stepping stone for these bright children to gain these skills and realize their full potential, regardless of their starting point in life. Lets move forward Singapore! Thank you!\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n1. You mentioned that you want to work with industry partners, why?\n\t- Industry partners will be able to bring in the expertise and special internal tools that may improve the children's learning. These are aspects which student volunteers do not have. \n\t- By meeting and interacting with people from the industry, we also hope that the children become inspired to discover more about the possibilities of technology.\n2. How long will KidsCode run for? Is it throughout the year?\n\t- Due to manpower being sourced from student volunteers, we will run the classes over the course of the regular school semester. This means classes will run for 4-5 months at a time. \n3. How would u inculcate resilience and confidence?\n\t- Resilience: our volunteers will act as mentors to help the kids through difficult problems that they face. For example, when their program does not work as they expect and have to make iterations, these situations will teach them the importance of not giving up, and when to seek help.\n\t- Confidence: each lesson is part of a larger project which the children are working on. By providing opportunities for them to showcase their work to the class as well as talk through their ideas and processes, we hope to build up their speaking confidence.\n4. Are the children obligated to join every lesson? What if they miss some.\n\t- The children encouraged to join every lesson, but there is no obligation for them to attend all. This is because we want to promote a culture of self-paced learning. \n5. Where is KidsCode held?\n\t- It will take place at various libraries, community centres and other public buildings around Singapore. Venues may change from run to run.\n6. How will you promote KidsCode to the community?\n\t- For a start, we will promote this initiative through social media as well as through public advertisements or brochures in selected community centers.\n\t- In terms of convincing parents of the importance of these skills, we will offer chances for parents to sit in and take a look at the work we do. This ensures transparency and allows the parents to make an informed decision about whether this programme is right for their child.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T03:09:20.508165264Z","tags":null}}
